# dlts-opensquare Hugo Theme

Open Square is NYU Pressâ€™s platform for publishing and reading open access books. This repository contains the custom Hugo theme for the Open Square website.

## Overview

This theme provides the visual structure and styling for the Open Square website, built using the Hugo static site generator. It includes layouts, partials, assets (SCSS, images, JavaScript), and configuration to create a cohesive and accessible user experience.

## Key Features

*   **Custom Design:**  Unique visual identity tailored for NYU Press Open Square.
*   **Responsive Layout:**  Utilizes Material Design Components (MDC) Layout Grid for flexible display across devices.
*   **SCSS Styling:**  Organized and maintainable styles using SCSS, including custom mixins and partials.

## Customization

The theme offers several ways to customize the appearance and functionality of your Open Square website:

*   **SCSS Variables:** Modify the SCSS variables in [`assets/style.scss`](assets/style.scss) to adjust colors, fonts, and spacing.
*   **Layouts:**  Override the theme's layouts by creating corresponding files in your project's `layouts` directory.  For example, to customize the book detail page, create a file at `layouts/books/single.html`.
*   **Partials:**  Similarly, override partials by creating files in your project's `layouts/partials` directory.
*   **Hugo Configuration:**  Use Hugo's configuration options to control various aspects of the site, such as menus, taxonomies, and site metadata.
