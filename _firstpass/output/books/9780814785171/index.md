Davis boldly examines the conflicted ethics behind a dominant American religious cultures justification and preservation of racial segregation in the reformulation of its post-slavery institutional presence in American society. His work provides a much-needed, critical discussion of the racial issues that pervaded American religion and culture in the early twentieth century.\"",
