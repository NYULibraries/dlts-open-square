   "description": "The Children of Immigrants at School explores the 21st-century consequences of immigration through an examination of how the so-called second generation is faring educationally in six countries: France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United States. In this insightful volume, Richard Alba and Jennifer Holdaway bring together a team of renowned social science researchers from around the globe to compare the educational achievements of children from low-status immigrant groups to those of mainstream populations in these countries, asking what we can learn from one system that can be usefully applied in another. Working from the results of a five-year, multi-national study, the contributors to The Children of Immigrants at School ultimately conclude that educational processes do, in fact, play a part in creating unequal status for immigrant groups in these societies. In most countries, the youth coming from the most numerous immigrant populations lag substantially behind their mainstream peers, implying that they will not be able to integrate economically and civically as traditional mainstream populations shrink. Despite this fact, the comparisons highlight features of each system that hinder the educational advance of immigrant-origin children, allowing the contributors to identify a number of policy solutions to help fix the problem. A comprehensive look at a growing global issue, The Children of Immigrants at School represents a major achievement in the fields of education and immigration studies.",

       "review": "\"Virtually all developed nations have become countries of immigration, and schools have  become the crucible for assimilation in each society.  The remarkable collection of studies  assembled by Richard Alba and Jennifer Holdaway reveal how the children of immigrants are  faring in schools of the United States, France, the Netherlands, Britain, Sweden, and  Spain.  Their comparative lens reveals the barriers to successful incorporation shared in all  settingssegregation, tracking, unequal school funding, concentrated disadvantage and  advantaged parents reacting to preserve the status quo.  But the institutional variety they  uncover also reveals many promising pathways forward.  The book is of value not only to  scholars of immigration, but to anyone concerned with educating the disadvantaged.\"",
