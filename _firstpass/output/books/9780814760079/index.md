Czerniawski also interviewed 35 plus size models about their lives in the world of fashion, bringing to life the strange contradictions of being an object of non-idealized beauty.Fashioning Fat shows us that the mission of many of these models is to challenge our standards of beauty that privilege the thin body; they show us that fat can be sexy. Many plus-size models do often succeed in overcoming years of self-loathing and shame over their bodies, yet, as Czerniawski shows, these women are not the ones in charge of beauty’s construction or dissemination. At the corporate level, the fashion industry perpetuates their objectification. Plus-size models must conform to an image created by fashion’s tastemakers, as their bodies must fit within narrowly defined parameters of size and shape—an experience not too different from that of straight-sized models. Ultimately, plus-size models find that they are still molding their bodies to fit an image instead of molding an image of beauty to fit their bodies.

       "review": "\"At once a sociological adventure and a moving personal voyage, Amanda Czerniawskis striking study of plus-size modeling shows the intense aesthetic labor that disciplines the body and shapes the self. Engagingly written, Fashioning Fat addresses the sociologies of work and the professions, of gender and the body, as well as the emergent field of fat studies. Like all good ethnography, this one takes us to a new world and insists upon its connections to the worlds we know.\"",
