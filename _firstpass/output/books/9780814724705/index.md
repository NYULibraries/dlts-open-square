   "description": "The nation’s Latina/o population has now reached over 50 million,  or 15% of the estimated total U.S. population of 300 million, and a  growing portion of the world’s population now lives and works in cities  that are increasingly diverse. Latino Urbanism provides the first  national perspective on Latina/o urban policy, addressing a wide range  of planning policy issues that impact both Latinas/os in the US, as well  as the nation as a whole, tracing how cities develop, function, and are  affected by socio-economic change.The contributors are a diverse group of Latina/o  scholars attempting to link their own unique theoretical interpretations  and approaches to political and policy interventions in the spaces and  cultures of everyday life. The three sections of the book address the  politics of planning and its historic relationship with Latinas/os, the  relationship between the Latina/o community and conventional urban  planning issue sand challenges, and the future of urban policy and  Latina/o barrios. Moving beyond a traditional analysis of Latinas/os in  the Southwest, the volume expands the understanding of the important  relationships between urbanization and Latinas/os including Mexican  Americans of several generations within the context of the restructuring  of cities, in view of the cultural and political transformation  currently encompassing the nation.",

       "review": "\"This vital collection of essays is a manifesto for the Latino/a ciudadanoor citizenand should catalyze a much-needed conversation among elected officials, urban planners, activists and scholars. With subtle theoretical insights and practical research from leaders in ethnic studies, architecture, urban planning, environmental studies, sociology and political science, this sweet fruit of interdisciplinary Latino/a studies speaks to the most pressing policy dilemmas of our time, including migration, housing and environmental injustice. Torres and Diazs volume shows how a long history of Latino urbanism has made and will make the citythe dwelling place of the worlds majoritymore liveable for all.\"",
