       "review": "\"This book is full of thick description and rich detail. Bielo has a knack for capturing the essence of the people he interacted wth in his 3 year ethnographic journey through Emerging Evangelicalism. The personalities come through in his description of their appearance and clothing, mannerisms and attributes, and in their voices in the text. His descriptions of gatherings and worship ritual are so vivid that at times I found myself transported through his prose back to my own ethnographic research on Emerging congregations.\"",

For these reasons, Emerging Evangelicals contains much of value to advanced scholars of Christianity, scholars of American Protestantism most of all.
