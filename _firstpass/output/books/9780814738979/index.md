As it turns out, surprisingly little.The Makeover  is the first book to consider the rapid rise of makeover shows from the  perspectives of their viewers. Katherine Sender argues that this genre  of reality television continues a long history of self-improvement,  shaped through contemporary media, technological, and economic contexts.  Most people think that reality television viewers are ideological dupes  and obliging consumers. Sender, however, finds that they have a much  more nuanced and reflexive approach to the shows they watch. They are  critical of the instruction, the consumer plugs, and the manipulative  editing in the shows. At the same time, they buy into the shows’  imperative to construct a reflexive self: an inner self that can be seen  as if from the outside, and must be explored and expressed to others. The Makeover intervenes  in debates about both reality television and audience research,  offering the concept of the reflexive self to move these debates  forward.",

       "review": "\"Like all ground-breaking studies of culture, The Makeover, appropriately, tells us not just about its object, narrowly construed, but about ourselves, the society we have created, and the contradictions that permeate both. Sender combines detailed empirical research with thoughtful and nuanced interpretation to provide us with a timely meditation on the limitsand potentialsof reflexivity. The result is a smart and original contribution to the way we think about popular culture and its relation to broader questions of self-hood, identity, and power.\"",

       "review": "\"With its central focus on audience practices, Senders lucidly-written book is unique among the growing body of scholarship on reality TV. While offering a smart and provocative analysis of the complex appeal of specific \u0026amp; makeover shows, she also makes a major contribution to active audience theory. In particular, she problematizes the issue of reflexivity, in the context both of viewers relationships with the shows and in their roles as research participants. In doing so she challenges all audience scholars to examine more carefully the very nature of the research encounter.\"",
