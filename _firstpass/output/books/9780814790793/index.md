It has come to epitomize lawlessness and has sparked protracted legal battles and political debate. For too long, however, Guant\u0026#225;namo has been viewed in isolation and has overshadowed a larger, interconnected global detention system that includes other military prisons such as Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, secret CIA jails, and the transfer of prisoners to other countries for torture.

Habeas expert and litigator Jonathan Hafetz gives us an insider\u0026#8217;s view of the detention of \u0026#8220;enemy combatants\u0026#8221; and an accessible explanation of the complex forces that keep these systems running. In the age of terrorism, some argue that habeas corpus is impractical and unwise. Hafetz advocates that it remains the single most important check against arbitrary and unlawful detention, torture, and the abuse of executive power.",

Anyone seeking a way forward on the issues of detention, incarceration, and the rule of law that continue to plague us would be well advised to start looking here for the answers.\"",

Certain to become one of the indispensable accounts of the role that the \u0026 Great Writ has played both historically and after September 11, this book provides a powerful and timely testament to the foresight of the Founding Fathers in expressly enshrining the \u0026 privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in our Constitution.\"",

This book by one of the key lawyers on the front lines in the post-9/11 legal battles puts these pieces together; what emerges is not pretty. If you want to understand how a country that claimed it was the paradigm of fair treatment in its criminal justice system has tailored its laws to expediency, read this disturbing book.\"",
