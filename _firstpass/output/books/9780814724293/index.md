We burrow beneath the surface, pretending to be what we are not, but at our best we emerge with sharper eyes and a more compassionate heart.\"",

From the Gilded Age to the present, Pittenger takes us on a journey with temporary down-and-outers as they tramp the countryside, experience the urban netherworld, and cross racial lines. He uncovers a tradition of critique and elitism; a struggle over the meaning of authenticityand more emerge in these pages.\"",

       "review": "\"Before anthropologists became 'participant observers' or Norman Mailer discovered the 'new journalism,' generations of socially engaged Americans assumed undercover identities and conducted covert investigations to experience and report upon the reality of life for the nations poor and marginalized. Mark Pittengers original and highly readable book illuminates the motivations and strategies of these reform-minded investigators, and the work they produced. Class Unknown enlarges our understanding of journalism, reform, and the shifting perceptions of social class in America. I enjoyed this book and learned from it.\"",

       "review": "\"With smooth prose, expansive reflection, and unerring eye for telling detail, Pittenger turns what may superficially seem an esoteric and even quirky subject into a major work of intellectual history and cultural criticism. The undercover investigations that he shows to be a mainstay of the American documentary tradition--from the writings of the Progressive Walter Wyckoff, the managerial studies of Elton Mayo, and the radical portraits of Donald Roy through books and film treatments of Laura Hobson (Gentlemen's Agreement) and Howard Griffin (Black Like Me) to the present-day commentaries of Barbara Ehrenreich--regularly attempt to 'domesticate difference'; i.e. they help a largely white, middle-class public to sympathize with and/or better control the behavior of an elusive ethnic, class, or racial Other.Whereas his 'class-passers' and 'down-and-outers' sought to familiarize readers with people rendered distant from themselves by their poverty or ascribed group identity, so Pittenger freshly portrays the investigators as a distinct set of middle-class professionals well worth knowing.\"",
