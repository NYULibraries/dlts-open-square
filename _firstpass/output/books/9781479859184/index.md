Through this examination, an understanding of what it means to each program to be a good religious American becomes clear.

       "review": "\"Drawn to the Gods is a thorough and comprehensive study that is grounded in solid research methodologies and linked to relevant theories and secondary literature. Feltmates arguments are compelling and insightful, and even quite lively--I love moving from Durkheim on the sacred to sacredness in Family Guy. Feltmate is quite adept at unpacking dense ideas about the sociology of religion and applying them to cultural studies in a rich, illuminating way.\"",

       "review": "\"Without a doubt, I will use this delightful, well-researched, well-crafted monograph in my media, religion, and popular culture courses. David Feltmates book is fun, but it is serious fun. He maps out how humor and satire, as delivered through media platforms, teach audiences how to think about religion in an American cultural context. In so doing, he makes a compelling case for why we need to take humor seriously, and why the vital realm of popular culture is not simply important but indeed central to our research in the study of religion.\"",

       "review": "\"Feltmate wisely focuses on three popular television programs that not only overflow with religious references but also often humorously subvert accepted ideas about religious beliefs and practices. Engaging in close readings of over 200 episodes of these shows, Feltmate explores the ways that they satirically question sacred texts, cults, Jesus, sacred sites, and various world religions.\"",
