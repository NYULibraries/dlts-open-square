       "review": "\"Neatly packaged, intelligently written, and intensely interesting. . . .Drawing on her training and personal experiences, Wood has written a book about development of the essence of oneself, impediments to fulfillment of personal needs, and encouragement of more satisying forms of self-expression. Her insightful vignettes illustrate both the rationale and application of the strategies she suggests and explain her terapeutic mistakes. Regardless of one's theoretical alliances and level of treatment expertise, this book can be used to enhance conceptualization of psychopathology, reevalaute the emotional climate fostered in the therapeutic situation, and refine processes for encouraging patient confidence, creativity, and positive affect. Compelling from intellectual and emotional standpoints, this compact volume is highly recoommeded to a general clinical readership.\"",
