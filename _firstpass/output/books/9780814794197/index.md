   "description": "Over the last four decades, the fashion modeling industry has become a lightning rod for debates about Western beauty ideals, the sexual objectification of women, and consumer desire. Yet, fashion models still captivate, embodying all that is cool, glam, hip, and desirable. They are a fixture in tabloids, magazines, fashion blogs, and television. Why exactly are models so appealing? And how do these women succeed in so soundly holding our attention?In This Year\u0026#8217;s Model, Elizabeth Wissinger weaves together in-depth interviews and research at model castings, photo shoots, and runway shows to offer a glimpse into the life of the model throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Once an ad hoc occupation, the \u0026#8220;model life\u0026#8221; now involves a great deal of physical and virtual management of the body, or what Wissinger terms \u0026#8220;glamour labor.\u0026#8221; Wissinger argues that glamour labor\u0026#8212;the specialized modeling work of self-styling, crafting a \u0026#8216;look,\u0026#8217; and building an image\u0026#8212;has been amplified by the rise of digital media, as new technologies make tinkering with the body\u0026#8217;s form and image easy.

With an eye for rich ethnographic detail, she takes us inside the world of modeling and skillfully back out again into the macro historical changes in embodiment and technology that modeling exemplifies.This Years Model delivers a rich and troubling history of how we have all come to manage ourselves as brands.Its the kind of book that will change how you think about your own bodys place in our high-tech world.\"",
