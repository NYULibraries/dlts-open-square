   "description": "An examination of the forces and events that led to the most successful organized crime control initiatives in American historySince Prohibition, the Mafia has captivated the media and, indeed, the American imagination.  From Al Capone to John Gotti, organized crime bosses have achieved notoriety as anti- heroes in popular culture.  In practice, organized crime grew strong and wealthy by supplying illicit goods and services and by obtaining control over labor unions and key industries. Despite, or perhaps because of, its power and high profile, Cosa Nostra faced little opposition from law enforcement.  Yet, in the last 15 years, the very foundations of the mob have been shaken, its bosses imprisoned, its profits diminished, and its influence badly weakened. In this vivid and dramatic book, James B. Jacobs, Christopher Panarella, and Jay Worthington document the government's relentless attack on organized crime.  The authors present an overview of the forces and events that led in the 1980s to the most successful organized crime control initiatives in American history.  Enlisting trial testimony, secretly taped conversations, court documents, and depositions, they document five landmark cases, representing the most important organized crime prosecutions of the modern era—Teamsters Local 560, The Pizza Connection, The Commission, the International Teamsters, and the prosecution of John Gotti.",
