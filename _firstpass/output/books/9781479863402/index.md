       "review": "\"After two decades of \u0026 get-tough policies that repudiated the original idea that \u0026 children are different, Choosing the Future for American Juvenile Justice provides an important and timely antidote. The essays examine both how politicians forgot juvenile courts founding principles and explore policy directions for the future. This outstanding collection by leading scholars examines important, but seldom addressed issues and concludes with a course of action for sensible policy reforms.\"",
