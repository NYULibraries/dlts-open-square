   "description": "How children helped abolish slaveryDuring the antebellum period, several abolitionist figures, including William Lloyd Garrison, the editor of the Liberator; Susan Paul, an African American primary school teacher; Henry Clarke Wright, a white reformer; and Frederick Douglass, the internationally renowned activist, consistently appealed to the sympathies of children against slavery. In 1835, Garrison proclaimed, “If . . . we desire to see our land delivered from the curse of PREJUDICE and SLAVERY, we must direct our efforts chiefly to the rising generation.” This rallying cry found a receptive audience and ignited action.Despite their limited scholarly exploration, children occupied a crucial position within the US abolition movement. Through a reexamination of archival materials including antislavery newspapers, correspondence, and autobiographies, Young Abolitionists is the first book to center children’s participation in the campaign to eradicate slavery in the United States.Michaël Roy uncovers how young advocates—Black and white alike—confidently delivered antislavery speeches within their schools, enrolled in juvenile antislavery societies, and contributed to the editorial process of antislavery newspapers. They aided fugitive slaves, attended antislavery fairs, and engaged in activities commemorating John Brown’s legacy. They even affixed their signatures to antislavery petitions, thus challenging the boundaries of their own citizenship.Abolitionists saw childhood as a force for social change. With the help of parents and teachers, children acted in concrete ways against slavery and made a meaningful contribution toward its demise. Young Abolitionists honors their contributions and reminds us that children can—and must—be included in the fight for a better world.",

Clear prose and apt illustrations will prompt specialists and general readers alike to see the abolitionist movement with fresh eyes.\"",

       "review": "\"In this concise, well-researched, and engaging study, Michaël Roy provides a definitive history of juvenile abolitionism. He explains why adult antislavery activists reached out to young people and documents the large number of Black and white children who joined juvenile antislavery societies, signed petitions, read abolitionist literature and tried to convert adults to the cause. In the process, these young activists ignited a debate over the political competence of minors that continues to resonate in today's youth movements for climate and racial justice. This is essential reading for those interested in the history of childhood and the history of social reform.\"",

In addition to chronicling what adults thought about children's capacities,  Roy reveals how both Black and White children imagined their own moral agency, and how they helped to both generate and propagate antislavery ideas,  through their work as readers, contributors, editors, and organizers. In short, this book expands the intellectual history of antislavery ideas in the transatlantic world.\"",
