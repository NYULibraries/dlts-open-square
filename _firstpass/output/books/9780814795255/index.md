In Is Breast Best? Joan B.  Wolf challenges the widespread belief that breastfeeding is medically  superior to bottle-feeding. Despite the fact that breastfeeding has  become the ultimate expression of maternal dedication, Wolf writes, the  conviction that breastfeeding provides babies unique health benefits and  that formula feeding is a risky substitute is unsubstantiated by the  evidence.
