A hybrid tradition made up primarily of indigenousand Iberian Catholic pharmacopeias, rituals, and notions of the self, curanderismo treats the sick person witha variety of healing modalities including herbal remedies, intercessory prayer,body massage, and energy manipulation. Curanderos,\u0026#8220;healers,\u0026#8221; embrace a holistic understanding of the patient, including body,soul, and community.Border Medicine examines the ongoingevolution of Mexican American religious healing from the end of the nineteenthcentury to the present. Illuminating the ways in which curanderismo has had an impact not only on the health and cultureof the borderlands but also far beyond, the book tracks its expansion from MexicanAmerican communities to Anglo and multiethnic contexts. While many healers treat Mexican and MexicanAmerican clientele, a significant number of curanderoshave worked with patients from other ethnic groups as well, especially thoseinvolved in North American metaphysical religions like spiritualism, mesmerism,New Thought, New Age, and energy-based alternative medicines.

       "review": "\"A powerful and beautifully written ethno-historical study of curanderismo in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. Brett Hendrickson deftly refuses to romanticize curanderos, their healing practices, or the men and women who go to them for help and guidance. He situates the complex religious and cultural realities of the historic and contemporary American Southwest, and shows how Mexican American lived borderlands religion fits within American religious history. Hendricksons portrayal of the rich and complex hybrid practice of Mexican American religious healing sets the new standard for how we will view healing, religious exchange, and hybridization among the U.S.-Mexico borderlands and beyond.\"",

       "review": "\"Provides an important approach to the study of religions and healing, offering a history of Mexican American healing in conversation with some Anglo `new age religious healing. Difficult, yes, but splendidly handled by this author. Hendrickson advances discussions of religions, medicines, and healing, looking at these topics with new eyes; the book itself a conversation starter that I highly recommend.\"",
