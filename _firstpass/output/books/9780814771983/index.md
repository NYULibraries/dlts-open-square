       "review": "\"This innovative qualitative study poignantly reveals the complex socio-historical and -ecological forces that impact self-perceptions and shape ethnic and cultural identities of Korean immigrant children. The authors provide, through the voices of their respondents, the difficulties and tensions created as children, throughout their lives, struggle to navigate the emotional bonds between their natal families their own nuclear families, to forge their dual identities as Korean-Americans. The story is universal for immigrants, but rarely told along the life course as Yoo and Kim have so deftly presented. The struggle to identify, straddle and eventually formulate a bicultural identity and reconcile conflicting cultural values and norms between the host and native culture is treacherous, painful, and inevitable. The individual stories of the participants powerfully illustrate the diversity of strategies individuals use to navigate these transitional passages  beginning with the power shift of helping their limited English speaking parents maneuver through the American society, finding their own sense of identities as Korean Americans, and struggling to choose which mix of values to transmit to their children and still honor their immigrant parents, who sacrificed so much to give the respondents access to the 'American Dream'.  This book is an important resource for academics and practitioners working in immigration issues, social service agencies, and mental and medical health. It is also a powerful resource for all immigrant populations  to help put their experiences in a larger context as they adapt to U.S. society.\"",

       "review": "\"To be able to look through a lens at how a community matures in a space not native is a precious opportunity. This writing by Yoo and Kim gives focus and voice to a part of Korean American reality that is well known within and completely unseen without. These stories are an integration of Korean tradition, American dreams and demands, and human passages through lifewonderful, warm, and true.\"",
