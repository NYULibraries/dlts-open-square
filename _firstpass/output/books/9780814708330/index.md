But what is the status of those who stand outside of language?The mentally disabled, \u0026#8220;wild\u0026#8221; children, people with autism and otherneurological disorders, as well as animals, infants, angels, and artificialintelligences, have all engaged with language from a position at its borders.In the intricate verbal constructions of modern literature, the\u0026#8216;disarticulate\u0026#8217;\u0026#8212;those at the edges of language\u0026#8212;have, paradoxically, playedessential, defining roles.     Drawing on the disarticulate figures inmodern fictional works such as Billy Budd, The Sound and the Fury,Nightwood, White Noise, and The Echo Maker, among others,James Berger shows in this intellectually bracing study how these charactersmark sites at which aesthetic, philosophical, ethical, political, medical, andscientific discourses converge.
