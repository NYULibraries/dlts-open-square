These fights take place at school, on street corners, or in parks, when one girl provokes another to the point that she must either \u0026#8220;step up\u0026#8221; or be labeled a \u0026#8220;punk.\u0026#8221; Typically, when girls engage in violence that is not strictly self-defense, they are labeled \u0026#8220;delinquent,\u0026#8221; their actions taken as a sign of emotional pathology.  However, in Why Girls Fight, Cindy D.

While most existing work on girls\u0026#8217; violence deals exclusively with gangs, Ness sheds new light on the everyday street fighting of urban girls, arguing that different cultural standards associated with race and class influence the relationship that girls have to physical aggression.",
