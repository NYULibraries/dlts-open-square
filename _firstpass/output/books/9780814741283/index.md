   "description": "More than anywhere else in the Western world, religious attachments in America are quite flexible, with over 40 percent of U.S. citizens shifting their religious identification at least once in their lives. In Changing Faith, Darren E. Sherkat draws on empirical data from large-scale national studies to provide a comprehensive portrait of religious change and its consequences in the United States. With analysis spanning across generations and ethnic groups, the volume traces the evolution of the experience of Protestantism and Catholicism in the United States, the dramatic growth of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam, and the rise of non-identification, now the second most common religious affiliation in the country. Drawing on that wealth of data, it details the impact of religious commitments on broad arenas of American social life, including family and sexuality, economic well-being, political commitments, and social values. Exploring religious change among those of European heritage as well as of Eastern and Western European immigrants, African Americans, Asians, Latin Americans, and Native Americans, Changing Faith not only provides a comprehensive and ethnically inclusive demographic overview of the juncture between religion and ethnicity within both the private and public sphere, but also brings empirical analysis back to the sociology of religion.",

       "review": "\"Provides a fascinating glimpse into the changing religious landscape in the U.S., telling us who the winners and losers have been in a half century of demographic and religious change. Using the best available data, Sherkat busts the myths concerning the rise in conservative Christianity, showing that non-Christians groups and unaffiliated nonbelievers have grown faster. Rather than supporting the notion that religions operate like a marketplace, Sherkat reminds us how important ethnic ties, immigrant origins, and fertility differentials are in contemporary religious affiliation. He makes a significant contribution by showing not just how religious affiliations have changed , but why it matters in how people form families and decide upon schooling and careers. If you want to know which denominations are growing or declining and, most importantly, why, this book is for you.\"",

This book identifies immigration and generational change as major sources of change in religious identification, and shows why 'grand theories' do not help us to understand the religious landscape. . . . An important book which will serve as a resource for scholars and students who want an accurate, empirically-based understanding of the causes and implications of Americans' changing religious identifications.\"",
