   "description": "The transformative impact of new reproductive technologies over the past half centuryBoth fertility and infertility are commonly depicted as individual, biological, and choice dependent conditions that can be mediated by technology. In contrast, The New Reproductive Order documents the complex material, historical, and political forces that both enable and limit human reproductivity, while also arguing that both fertility and infertility have become condensed symbols of wider changes to family forms, national political agendas, global economies, and local environments. Combining anthropological, sociological, and intersectional feminist research from across the globe, this landmark volume reveals how changing perceptions of fertility and infertility are altering how people imagine, pursue, and experience reproductivity both individually and collectively. Using a comparative global methodology based on detailed case studies, The New Reproductive Order persuasively argues that changing perceptions of fertility and infertility are giving rise to a distinctive reproductive politics based on new models of reproductive cause and effect. This groundbreaking and sophisticated volume opens new horizons of scholarship on the relationship between fertility, infertility, reproductive technologies, and social change, as well as new thinking on policy, practice, and activism in the twenty-first century’s new reproductive order.",

An audacious – and very salutary – project of reconceptualization, this volume works on the kind of scale that redraws whole fields.\"",

       "review": "\"Could not be more timely or valuable, coming out as crucial elections are turning on questions about IVF and abortion, fertility and infertility, as assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are increasingly available, yet politically contested. And once again, feminist activists are mobilizing over the need to control their reproductive lives. Editors and authors Sarah Franklin and Marcia Inhorn have pulled together an extraordinary group of authors, all using what they call a “reprolens” to help readers understand “repronationalisms” regarding the state of assisted reproductive technologies across the globe. This paradigm-changing collection is required reading for scholars and activists across a range of disciplines, providing the ideas and cases we need to understand the range and complexity of contemporary reproductive imaginaries in the age of ARTs.\"",
