The percentage of those in the discipline who live and work in the United States has been growing smaller, and it is now impossible to completely understand the field if developments in psychology outside of the United States are ignored.Internationalizing the History of Psychology brings together luminaries in the field from around the world to address the internationalizing of psychology, each raising core issuesconcerning what an international perspective can contributeto the history of psychology and to our understanding of psychology as a whole. For too long, much of what we havetaken to be the history of psychology has actually been thehistory of American psychology. This volume, ideal for student use and for those in the field, illuminates how what we have been missing may change our views of the nature of psychology and its history.Contributors: Ruben Ardila, Geoffrey Blowers, Adrian C.

Instead of a uniform topography where only certain features count, and the only places worth studying are those that are home to the original map-makers, this book offers a new cartography for those willing to invest in different landscapes of psychology. For those who wish to glimpse the future of psychology, there is no better place to begin than with this historical volume.\"",
