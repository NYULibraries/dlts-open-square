<p>Welcome to knowledge without boundaries!</p>
<p>Open Square is <a href="https://nyupress.org/" target="_blank" class="external">NYU Press</a>’s platform for publishing and reading <a href="https://guides.nyu.edu/openaccess" target="_blank" class="external">open access</a> books. A browser-based reading platform, Open Square enables us to increase the impact of scholarly work by making it freely available in a digital format and to experiment with new ways of presenting scholarship and adding enhanced content to traditionally published books. Open Square features new and recently published titles as well as a growing library of classic backlist publications. NYU Press is committed to expanding our offerings in both categories. </p>
<p>Print copies of any of these books can be purchased by clicking the “Buy the Book” link on each title’s detail page.</p>
<p>This site uses <a href="http://readium.github.io/" target="_blank" class="external">Readium</a>, an open source software package for handling EPUB documents.
The site was developed by our colleagues in the <a href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/dlts/" target="_blank" class="external">NYU Libraries Digital Library Technology Services</a> department. Development is ongoing, and new features and improvements are planned.</p>
<p>Open Square is optimized for use on Chrome and Firefox browsers on Mac and Windows.</p>
