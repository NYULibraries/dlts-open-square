       "review": "\"This is an important book for thinking about the relationship between science and public culture. Instead of simply looking at media representations of science, it demonstrates so well how the public sphere itself is a sociotechnical assemblage of networked devices, concepts, bodies, measurements, and various audiences. Malin steers a clear course between technological determinism and social constructivism. We think, feel, and act in relationship with our tools, but it is precisely this relationship that matters. In the end, he leaves the reader with a rich picture of mass media as an assemblage whose infrastructure includes the often neglected social technologies of the human sciences.\"",

       "review": "\"A wide mixtureof scholarly disciplines across the last century contribute to Malin's history. They are represented by social scientists, psychologists, media and communications theorists, as well as philosophers. For historians of psychology, Feeling Mediated offers extended commentary on the work of three psychologists who are less frequently acknowledged in the literature.\"",

       "review": "\"[] Malin sharpens his weapons against prevalent narratives of oversimplification, which many times also serve to perpetuate discrimination by class, gender, and race. Nailing the big irony of this trope, Malin also argues how the laboratory instruments measure other new technologies in ways that create a complex feedback loop.\"",

       "review": "\"Using a wide range of archival research and several historical examples of technology's relationship with emotion, Malin demonstrates how communication technology changed the way people think about emotion and continues to . . . .

       "review": "\"In reconstructing the debates surrounding media physicalism, Malin draws on substantial archival and primary-source research, and brings in as well intelligent discussions of the history of psychology and the philosophy of mind. Ultimately, his critique of media physicalism underscores the necessity of apprehending the historical situatedness of media technologies, showing how race, class, and gender norms were built into various media and the systems set up to measure their impact.\"",
