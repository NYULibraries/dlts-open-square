       "review": "\"Labors of Love is without parallel in the nursing home literature.  No other ethnographer has written in such a finely detailed way about the worlds of nursing home managers. In this book, Jason Rodriquez spells out in riveting detail how nursing home managers respond to a system that incentivizes dependence and incapacity rather than independence and restorative care, how they must put on a show\" for state inspectors that does  not and cannot reflect the reality of normal day-to-day operations, and how the current regulatory framework actively discourages authentic emotional relationships between caregivers and recipients.  Labors of Love will change the terms of the national debate about nursing homes.\"",
