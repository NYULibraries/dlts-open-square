       "review": "\"Pamela Cochran interweaves two engaging stories in this carefully researched study, both of which are vitally important to our understanding of American evangelicalism. One story is about the small cadre of  feminist leaders within evangelicalism who struggled heroically against the tide of rising political conservatism and male dominance.  The other is about evangelicalism's often unwitting embrace of biblical hermeneutics, therapeutic individualism, and consumerism, and its difficulties in adapting to an increasingly pluralistic culture.  Scholars in religious studies, history, and the social sciences will benefit greatly from reading this book.\"",
