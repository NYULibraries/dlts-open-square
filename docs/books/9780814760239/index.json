   "description": "How do economic conditions such as poverty, unemployment, inflation, and economic growth impact youth violence? Economics and Youth Violence provides a much-needed new perspective on this crucial issue. Pinpointing the economic factors that are most important, the editors and contributors in this volume explore how different kinds of economic issues impact children, adolescents, and their families, schools, and communities.Offering new and important insights regarding the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and youth violence across a variety of times and places, chapters cover such issues as the effect of inflation on youth violence; new quantitative analysis of the connection between race, economic opportunity, and violence; and the cyclical nature of criminal backgrounds and economic disadvantage among families. Highlighting the complexities in the relationship between economic conditions, juvenile offenses, and the community and situational contexts in which their connections are forged, Economics and Youth Violence prompts important questions that will guide future research on the causes and prevention of youth violence.Contributors: Sarah Beth Barnett, Eric P.

I recommend this book highly to researchers in violence studies.\"",

       "review": "\"This volume highlights the importance of addressing youth violence not only as a family or individual problem but one that is influenced in a number of ways by socioeconomic conditions within the neighborhood, community, and larger society. To reduce youth violence, policies must move beyond a focus on the individual or family and take into consideration the interaction between such factors as unemployment, family structure, and child/adolescent development on youth violence.\"",

In addition, the project never abandons a hopeful undertone. With the existing data and outlined directions for further research, Rosenfeld and colleagues contend that youth engagement in violent behavior can be minimized when youth are properly engaged with their surroundings, therefore making youth not a mere symptom of their environment.\"",
