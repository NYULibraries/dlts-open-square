   "description": "Part of the American Literatures Initiative Series American Arabesque examines representations of Arabs, Islam and the Near East in nineteenth-century American culture, arguing that these representations play a significant role in the development of American national identity over the century, revealing largely unexplored exchanges between these two cultural traditions that will alter how we understand themtoday.Moving from the period of America's engagement in theBarbary Wars through the Holy Land travel mania in the years of Jacksonian expansion and into the writings of romantics such as Edgar Allen Poe, the book argues that not only were Arabs and Muslims prominently featured in nineteenth-century literature, but that the differences writers established between figures such as Moors, Bedouins, Turks and Orientals provide proof of the transnational scope of domestic racial politics. Drawing on both English and Arabic language sources, Berman contends that the fluidity and instabilityof the term Arab as it appears in captivity narratives, travel narratives,imaginative literature, and ethnic literature simultaneously instantiate and undermine definitions of the American nation and American citizenship.",

       "review": "\"American Arabesque succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is its forging of a method of transnational scholarship. Berman places importance on translation, not only in terms of linguistics but also in terms of cultural forms. The result is a nuanced read of densely overlapping cultural forms and ideas...This is an important scholarly intervention that is sure to push forward transnational scholarship.\"",

       "review": "\"Berman's work opens up extended vistas for consideration, and the central accomplishment of the book is immense: by reading Arabic-language texts from North Africa contrapuntally in relation to English-language texts, Berman points toward the possibility of reading nineteenth-century American literature through frames that are far more genuinely planetary and cosmopolitan that has yet been achieved. Berman's study makes an important, indeed vital, contribution to the field of studies of American Orientalism and of Orientalism in Poe's work specifically.\"",

       "review": "\"American Arabesque is daringly ambitious.As a work of scholarship, it ventures an extraordinary range of reference, involving old and new works in English and Arabic. As a challenge to think differently about the United States in a larger world, it ventures to name its perspective \u0026 dirty cosmopolitanism. It makes good on both these risks.\"\u003c/span\"",

       "review": "\"Berman evokes the figure of the arabesque as a mediation between what is \u0026 Arab and its representation in the U.S. context, thereby turning the duality of Us vs. Them into a fluid field of interplay and modulation of representations that perform discrete ideological functions for different agents and under different circumstances. Yet Berman is not content to read American literature with a focus on the arabesque; he employs a theoretical perspective that blends classical Arabic hermeneutics and contemporary literary and cultural theory. This is an original contribution to American and Arab American studies that displays genuine intellectual imagination.\"",
