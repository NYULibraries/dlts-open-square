       "review": "\"Provides the first comprehensive overview of the development of the American Baháí community from 1963 to 2013, a crucial fifty year period that saw its membership expand fifteen times and its resources , literature, and capacities develop commensurately. McMUllen explores the challenges of consolidation of the new members, of building new institutions, and of reaching to the public with the Baháí teachings, challenges that remain today. By focusing on the letters from the Universal House of Justice, the Baháí Faiths world-wide governing body, and those of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháís of the United States, he provides a unique window into the role of Bahá'í institutions in planning, shaping, and steering the Faiths growth.\"",
