Mires has an eye for the telling vignette, a skill for plumbing the archives and interrogating the documentary and visual record, and an ability to see the large in the small and vice versa. Although the book's accessibility is sure to gain it a wide nonacademic readership, scholars, particularly those with an interest in such topics as the United Nations, modern U.S. history, civic engagement, and postwar internationalism, will find it more than worth their time.\"",

It is a story, she notes, that has been largely ignored by most previous historians of the United Nations. Mires does not limit herself to a bloodless account of bureaucratic maneuverings; instead, she embeds her narrative in a broader framework that traces the history of the international organization back to the early nineteenth century.\"",

By ascribing meaning to this competition rooted in the defining historical moment in which it took place, Mires offers us an innovative transnational history that provides an unexpected twist to understandings of glocalization.\"",

In a refreshing turn, Mires offers insight into a period that lies midway between the booster strategies of the nineteenth century...and the more intense place marketing and branding efforts of cities around the world in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century,\" keeping the story firmly focused on the efforts to determine a location while leaving the more minute details of the UN's formation for other scholars to explain. As a result we are treated to ambitious visions of a world capital tucked into South Dakota's Black Hills, or isolated Sugar Island near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The quick dissolution of plans calling for 40 to 50 square miles of landone can hardly imagine Westchester County, New York, as home to a teeming international metropolisto a mere parcel in New York City deftly summarizes the grand ambition and brief optimism of lasting peace that permeated existed after the end of WWII.\"",

Nowadays, many refer to New York City as the 'cultural capital of the world,' for various and obvious reasons. Beyond the apparent diversity of its inhabitants, New York City has hosted the United Nations headquarters for over 60 years, hence the 'world capital.' Back in the 1940s, New York City was not a shoe-in location however; over 200 cities and townships throughout the globe strived, campaigned and lobbied to become the host of the United Nations Headquarters. Philly was not only one of the hundreds competing to become this global capital, but it just about persuaded the world's diplomats to call Philadelphia home - until an unexpected turn of events.\"",

       "review": "\"Polls have repeatedly indicated that many New Yorkers wouldn't mind if the UN left their city lock, stock, and barrel, taking its bureaucracy and parking-violating diplomats along.  The irony is not lost on Mires, for, as she reveals in her surprising and often amusing work, New York won\" the privilege to host the UN after a furious, sometimes sad, and sometimes comical competition with other cities and locales.  Some of the competitors were seriously considered, including San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, and even an Ontario Island near Niagara Falls. Others, including the Black Hills of South Dakota, never had a chance.  Mires shows how the competition was triggered by a combination of municipal pride, boosterism, and an eagerness to reap the financial rewards that were expected to accrue to the host city.  Mires also captures the pervading sense of optimism amongst the claimants after the horrors of WWII.  This is a very readable, entertaining account that is aimed at a general audience.\"",
