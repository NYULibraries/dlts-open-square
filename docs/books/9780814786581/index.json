It provides a foundational overview of the current major theories in organizational psychology, and illuminates the impact of cultural differences on organizational dynamics. It also makes available specific research concerning our current understandings of how these dynamics play out in particular regions and countries, such as autocratic versus democratic leadership styles in Africa and Europe or conflict management in Asia.

       "review": "\"A tour de force. A highly readable, thorough and comprehensive review of the field, it will be used in undergraduate courses because it is so clearly written and well organized. This volume will be used in graduate courses because of the exhaustive scope of the research on which it is based. In addition to being a first-rate organizational psychology text, the book also provides much needed information about how the theories and practices of Western organizational psychology does and does not fit the reality of other countries around the globe. Written by a man from two cultures (the UK and the US) who is a master teacher, a former dean, a well-published scientist and a practicing organizational consultant, wisdom, compassion and creativity ooze from every page of this book. Although all the major topics of organizational psychology are well covered (leadership, work motivation, managerial skills, job satisfaction, conflict and power, communication and negotiation, personnel issues, etc.) what is unique about this volume is the wide-ranging view of its author. Throughout the book, Silverthorne reflects on issues of justice, demographic change, gender and mini-cultures within single states. It is a notable achievement.\"",

       "review": "\"A rich and fascinating read. . . . Silverthorne has performed the equally daunting and important tasks of bridging the chasms that exist between cultures and bridging disciplinary and methodological perspectives regarding organizations and cultures. I was particularly impressed by the text's exceptional scope. Silverthorne has mapped an entire terrain-ranging from leadership to motivation and from problem-solving to the management of stress. I will be strongly recommending this book to my consulting and coaching colleagues who cross national and cultural boundaries.\"",
