This is a little known fact that has gone under-researched in the US until now. Patricia Melzers Death in the Shape of a Young Girl goes a long way to addressing this omission.\"",

       "review": "\"Death in the Shape of a Young Girl is so deeply revealing of how the actual complex gender politics of a radical movement get swept under the media's rug of stereotypes. Melzer shows us in gripping detail how intensely the women inside this 1970s German underground movement interacted with the feminist debates of the time. Anyone interested in social movements, feminism in the Cold War, and the genderings of political violence will have their minds opened by reading this book.\"",
