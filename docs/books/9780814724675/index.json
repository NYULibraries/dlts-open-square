       "review": "\"Beautifully illustrates the complex intersections of religion and immigration, where even the successful navigation of the dangerous migrants journey across the U.S. border results not in the 'American dream,' but in continued poverty and marginalization. . . . Religion within the context of immigration is not merely one of 'the things they carry,' but fundamental to the journey, helping migrants to frame their understanding of suffering, to confront life-and-death, and to define their notions of the possible. Yet Sarat suggests that this understanding alone is not enough, arguing that religionmodern Pentecostalism in particularhelps empower people to look beyond simple religious tropes and issues of individual salvation to join collective efforts that seek to address the roots causes of migration and inequality.\"",
