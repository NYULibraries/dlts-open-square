       "review": "\"A deeply researched, provocative synthesis of the ways in which race has been conceptualized in Brazil, United States and France. Arguing that \u0026 All nations are transnations, the authors explore the \u0026 Red, \u0026 Black and \u0026 White Atlantic, tracking the circulation of ideas and their translation. In doing so, they critically address both the rightist and leftist blindness to race. This is a balanced, thoughtful and clearly written work that should be used widely in university classrooms.\"",
