Ortiz examines the pivotal role the bonus question played in stoking the anti-New Deal movement lead by Charles Coughlin and Huey Long and how settling this issue proved essential for FDRs decisive electoral victory in 1936.\"",

Thanks to him, historians will be compelled to rewrite their accounts of the age of Roosevelt.\"",
